1640995200,"Had an idea today while frustrated with my banking app crashing again. Why is personal finance so complicated? Everyone I talk to struggles with budgeting and saving money. There has to be a better way to make financial planning simple and intuitive.",ideation,concept_birth
1641081600,"Spent the weekend researching the personal finance market. Talked to friends, family, coworkers about their money problems. The pain is real - people want to save but existing tools are either too complex or too simplistic. I think there's a gap here.",ideation,market_research
1641168000,"Started sketching out my vision for a simple, AI-powered budgeting app. Core idea: automatically categorize spending, predict future expenses, and give gentle nudges toward financial goals. No overwhelming charts or confusing investment advice - just simple money management.",ideation,solution_design
1641254400,"Did competitive analysis of existing finance apps. Mint is too cluttered, YNAB is too rigid, most others are just expense trackers. None of them really understand user behavior or provide intelligent insights. My approach feels different - more like a financial coach than a calculator.",ideation,competitive_analysis
1641340800,"Created my first wireframes and user stories. Key features: smart categorization, predictive spending alerts, goal-based savings recommendations, and a clean interface that doesn't intimidate. The AI component will learn user patterns and provide personalized financial guidance.",design,prototype_planning
1641427200,"Started learning React Native to build a cross-platform prototype. Never built a mobile app before but the tutorials are helpful. Also researching machine learning libraries for the AI features. This is going to be a steep learning curve but I'm excited.",development,technical_learning
1641513600,"Wrote my first lines of code for the app. Basic login screen and expense entry form working. The UI is rough but functional. Also started building a simple machine learning model to categorize transactions. Progress feels slow but steady.",development,coding_basics
1641600000,"Integrated Plaid API for bank account connections. Took three days to get it working properly but now I can pull real transaction data. The categorization algorithm is getting better - about 80% accuracy so far. The app is starting to feel real.",development,integration_work
1641686400,"Built the core budgeting engine and prediction algorithms. Users can set spending limits by category and the app warns them when they're approaching limits. The predictive model can forecast next month's expenses with decent accuracy. Still needs lots of refinement.",development,core_features
1641772800,"Created a basic AI-powered insights feature. The app now notices spending patterns and suggests optimizations - like 'You spend 40% more on coffee on Mondays' or 'You could save $200/month by reducing weekend dining out.' The insights feel genuinely helpful.",development,ai_features
1641859200,"Finished my MVP! Basic expense tracking, smart categorization, budget management, and AI insights all working. The interface is clean and the features feel cohesive. Time to get some real users to test it. My friends and family will be my first guinea pigs.",development,mvp_complete
1641945600,"Started beta testing with 20 close contacts. The feedback is incredibly positive - people love how simple and smart it feels compared to other finance apps. Found several bugs and UX issues to fix, but the core concept is resonating. This might actually work.",testing,beta_feedback

1642464000,"Received our first term sheet! $2M seed round led by a fintech-focused VC. The valuation is fair and they bring great connections in the banking industry. Now I need to think about building a real team and scaling the technology infrastructure.",fundraising,term_sheet
