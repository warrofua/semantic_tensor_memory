Or:
```
You: Your message
AI: Response
You: Next message
```

## 🎯 **Perfect For**

- **Personal Growth**: See how your interests and thinking have evolved
- **Learning Journey**: Track your progression in topics you're studying
- **Communication Analysis**: Understand your questioning and interaction patterns
- **Curiosity Satisfaction**: Discover patterns you never noticed!

## 🔍 **What You'll See**

### **Instant Summary**
- Total messages analyzed
- Semantic drift percentage (how much you've changed)
- Communication style insights
- Topic evolution overview

### **Detailed Analysis**
- **📊 Overview**: Communication patterns and metrics
- **🌊 Evolution**: Visual drift analysis between messages
- **💭 Insights**: Deep interpretation of your semantic journey

### **Example Insights**
- *"You show dramatic transformation in communication patterns (65% drift)"*
- *"You ask many questions (curious/exploratory style)"*
- *"Your conversations evolved from 'programming basics' to 'machine learning optimization'"*

## 🚀 **How to Use**

1. **Get Your Chat History**
   - ChatGPT: Settings → Export Data
   - Claude: Copy conversations to text file
   - Other AIs: Save as text with User/Assistant labels

2. **Upload to Universal STM**
   - Go to the app at `http://localhost:8501`
